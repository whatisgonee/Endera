*The diary of Noel Ardon*

Writing Table of Noel Ardon:
7th September, 2119: It's 8 in the morning. Today we're going to blow up that asteroid once and for all. I hope this will work. I've been thinking yesterday, what if this won't help? I mean, NASA said that blowing up A64 will change its trajectory, but what if the asteroid will just fall apart? What if little meteors will fall on the Moon and destroy everything? I hope this will work.
