Chapter I: Brief History

In this chapter, we're going to talk about the history of our world, especially, the journey from polluting and killing our home planet, to a space empire, which we live in.

*The Moon*

It was a very difficult, yet exciting path to becoming a space empire. It all started in 20th July, 1969, when the first man landed on the Moon. The Moon means a lot to us, it is our playground, where we can test and develop new technology. Because of the Moon, we managed to colonise Mars without too many casualties. Let's go through the history of the Moon.

In 2045, the USA, together with Russia, China and the UK, decided to build a moon base. The plan was to create a small base for the first colonisers, which would arrive in 2055. It will have a storage, containing food, oxygen, water, and other equipment, bedrooms, where the colonisers will temporarily live, kitchen and a gym. The base will be used as a temporary shelter for researches, who will be staying on Moon for a few days. The project started in May, 2045, and was finished, as planned, in September, 2054, after almost a decade. The base was called 'Small Steps'. It will later become the first ever permanent moon base, where researches, engineers and astronauts will live. It was the first step to exploring and colonising our solar system. 

In 2078, NASA decided to make a moon station, an automatic station which will receive and launch spaceships from the Moon to Earth, and vice versa. The project was planned to finish in 2083, but because of the budget cuts, it was finished after nearly a decade, in 2085. The station, which is now known as The Launcher, was first used to slow down automatic ships, which delivered food and water to the inhabitants on the Moon, and then launch them back to Earth. This scheme required less fuel, since ships only had to get to the Launcher, and then slow down when approaching Earth. The project was a success, and NASA built another Launcher on Earth, with the same purpose. It is known as L2 (Launcher 2).

In 2103, the moon base expanded rapidly, covering more and more territory on the Moon. It started building its own infrastructure, like mining iron, magnesium, and other metal, which were quite rare on Earth. Small Steps declared their independence in 2117, when they started exporting minerals to Earth. The population mainly consisted of highly trained specialist, like botanist, physicist, astronomers, engineers and biologist. They laid the first brick into the Moon we know today. They developed infrastructure, which started producing food, water and oxygen, independently from Earth. Soon enough, rich people started moving to the Moon. It became the first ever country outside Earth's atmosphere. 

This concludes the history of the Moon of late 21st century to early 22nd. Humanity was slowly maturing and getting out of its lullaby. But the great challenge was still ahead. Our ancestors will soon encounter another problem, and this time, it can destroy everything we built.
