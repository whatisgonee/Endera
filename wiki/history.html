			<p class="text">In 2045, after the <a href="https://whatisgonee.github.io/endera/wiki/Second_great_pandemic">Second Great Pandemic</a>, the USA, together with other leading countries like China, Russia, etc., started a project called <a href="https://whatisgonee.github.io/endera/wiki/Space_Is_Close">'Space Is Close'</a>. The main goal was to create a moon base by 2055. The first rocket, carrying equipement for future base, was launched in 2048. By 2054, 'Space Is Close' was complete, creating the first base outside the Earth. The moon base, called <a href="https://whatisgonee.github.io/endera/wiki/First_Steps">'First Steps'</a>, started to expand. By 2063, First Steps was as big as New-York. It became the main hub for launching rockets and sattelites to other planets and greatly increased the Earth economics by extracting metals not commonly found on Earth. By the end of the 21st century, another moon base was build, called <a href="https://whatisgonee.github.io/endera/wiki/Big_Leap">'Big Leap'</a>, a few hundered kilometers from First Steps.<br>Big Leap had a great significance on the future space travel, since it was mainly built for launching startships from the Moon, rather than the Earth. In 2102, the first starship was launched to Mars in an attempt to seek future home, since the Earth was slowly 'dying' due to human activities. In 2107, UN organized a mission to save the planet and started producing numerous devices to suck CO2 out of the atmosphere, as well as restoring multiple ecosystems and cleaning the ocean. They also created new laws which obligated most countries to participate in the green project too. By the end of 2112, 90% of human made greenhouse gases were removed from the atmosphere and stored for future projects like terraforming Mars and other planets. By the end of 2120, a lot of companies started to create their own rockets, ships and sattelites. The <a href="https://whatisgonee.github.io/endera/wiki/Alter_Worlds_Inc">'Alter World Inc.'</a> started as a scientific project to seek other earth-like planets in an attempt to find life. It soon grew to be one of the most advanced and biggest company on Earth, owning more than 3000 ships for transporting resources between planets, and over 1500 sattelites to look for radiosignals. Unfortunately, the project failed, but 'Alter World Inc.' wasn't closed. It was renamed to 'Discovery Corporation' in 2131, but got its old name back after a few years, and started to sell products to masses such as personal starships, electronic devices and personal ship management systems.<br>A huge discovery was made in 2176, when one of the NASA's departement found that blackholes are actually entrances to the <a href="https://whatisgonee.github.io/endera/wiki/Wormhole">wormhole</a>. The reason it wasn't discovered earlier, was that <a href="https://whatisgonee.github.io/endera/wiki/Whitehole">whiteholes</a>, exit of the wormhole, gave off so much light, that from Earth they looked like stars. The discovery made a boom and from that moment, many people started designing wormhole stations. However, the problem was to create the wormhole, the blackhole <em>and</em> the whitehole, that wouldn't take much energy to sustain. It was also unknown whether the wormhole would rip the human body or not. So projects to create <a href="https://whatisgonee.github.io/endera/wiki/Wormhole_transportation.html">wormhole transportation</a> were abandoned until 2201.<br>This concludes the most important inventions and discoveries of 21st and 22nd centuries. During 23rd century (current century), many of the ideas, that were previously impossible to create, from 22nd century were used, such as wormhole transportation system, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere">Dyson Sphere</a> and <a href="https://whatisgonee.github.io/endera/wiki/Antiparticle_engine.html">antiparticle engines</a>. Null Particles were also discoverd (see below).</p>

			<div class="innerDivider"></div>
			<div class="text-footer">Main Article: <a href="https://whatisgonee.github.io/endera/wiki/Null_particles.html" class="link-footer">Null Particles</a></div>
			<p class="text">The Null Particles are very unique and mysterious. They were discovered in 2203, a few years after the wormhole transportation invention. The Null Particles are only observed for a short amount of time after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_production">pair production</a> proccess is complete. The Null Particles shortly disappear after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation">particle-antiparticle pair annihilates</a>. These particles cannot be observed by our latest technologies. The only way to know that the null particle was created is to observe its effect on the space around it.<br>The Null Particles emit a lot of energy when interact with regular matter, so in 2257, after the first null particle was trapped in a special container, the <a href="https://whatisgonee.github.io/endera/wiki/Null_particle_engine">Null Particle Engine</a> was created. The Null Engine can provide enormous amount of energy using a single null particle. The null particle does not annihhilate with regular matter. However, the regular particle dissappears, giving off twice the energy it stored. The Null Particle was the first indestructable particle in the universe. Many scientists worried that it may cause bad consequences, but the proccess has already started. From 2257, three Null Engines were created. They were mainly used by governments for fueling their countries, but one engine is used by the 'Alter World Inc.'.<br>Alter World Inc. started researching the null particles to find out where they come from, their properties, mass, radius, etc. It is still unknown the exact shape, mass and radius of a null particle, since it can not be measured by any of our modern technologies<a id="footnote1Ref" href="#footnote1">[1]</a>. However, Alter World Inc. found that null particles may come from an alternate world, confirming the existence of multiverse<a id="footnote2Ref" href="#footnote2">[2]</a>, but the scientist are not sure how the null particles come to our reality. It is possible that null particles come through anomalies or disturbtions in space and time. These anomalies usually appear near blackholes, leading to a theory that blackholes can rip through spacetime, making tunnels to the other universes.</p>

			<div class="innerDivider"></div>
			<div class="text-footer">Main Article: <a href="https://whatisgonee.github.io/endera/wiki/Null_Breakout.html">Null Breakout</a></div>
			<p class="text">The Null Breakout is an anomaly, that occured during one of the experiments to get into another reality, from which null particles supposedly come from. It is described as 'a rip in spacetime that leads null particles into our world'. Unlike regular null partices, the <a href="https://whatisgonee.github.io/endera/wiki/Null_matter.html">null matter</a> from another reality is higly dangerous as it has a sort of consciousness. It is unknown whether the null matter is being controled by someone from other reality, now called <a href="https://whatisgonee.github.io/endera/wiki/Null_home.html">Null home</a>, or if it is sentient. Null matter reacts with regular matter, but unlike antimatter, it does not annihilate, it vaporizes the regular particle, while being unaffected by it. The null matter is thought to be unnstoppable, since it destroys everything on its path. Null matter first appeared near the rip, around Alpha Centauri, and is slowly spreading towards the blackhole, leading to solar system. In response to null matter, the UN made a group called 'The Null Fighters'. Their main job is to try and stop the null matter from spreading towards the Earth. The evacuation of Alpha Centauri system has already been complete, so the job is to close the portal leading to solar system, thus, giving enough time to come up with the solution. The Alter World Inc. and some other organizations have already started researching the null matter and the rip, but it is highly difficult, since the equipment breaks down if it comes close. There were also some talks about alien like creatures<a href="#footnote3" id="footnote3Ref">[3]</a> that come from the rip, but this information still to be proven. If it turns out to be true, the humanity has a high chance of ceasing.</p>
			<h3 style="margin-top:-20px" id="subheading">Current situation</h3>
			<p class="text">Currently, the Null Breakout has reached the first pitstop to Alpha Centauri, which is about three weeks away from the portal, given its current state of progression.</p>
