# Endera
A word building project.

What's better than creating your own, unique, world? 
What's better than creating kingdoms, characters and stories in your own world? 
What's better than literally playing god?

Endera is a personal project. The goal is to achieve making a whole new world, with its own history, languages and culture.
The idea is to slowly create a new world, building from scratch, from the prehistoric times to the modern days. Magic and 
science. War and peace. Everything together is a unique harmony. 

It's time for Endera.
